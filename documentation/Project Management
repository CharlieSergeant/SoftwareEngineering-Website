We use the agile methodology to manage our project. 
We usually have online scrums, but we did have several real face-to-face scrums.  
We use Teambition as our project management tool. 
We got the user stories from the project assignment. 
The leader would plan tasks for each team member according to Sprint Plan Meeting, and then the leader would update the tasks on Teambition. 
Team members would try to finish the tasks in time. We use GitHub Discussions to discuss and make scrum appointments. 
We will update our programs and documentations in GitHub Repositories.
