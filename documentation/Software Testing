We use Postman to test our restful APIs. We prepared different cases, which include both right data sets and wrong data sets. 
The restful APIs pass all the tests. 
For the authentication system, we use both correct password and wrong passwords to test. 
The tester also failed to enter the system without authentication.
The tester also prepared many date sets to test the functions. 
The system always return the correct results supposed to be generated.
