The system design is like a common website, the users need to log in to use the functions. 
In other words, the user should use a web browser to visit our website and log in to choose the functions he or she wanted to use on the main page. 
There are three main functions: viewing statistical information, viewing charts, and viewing history. 
As for the software development, Fangzhou would implement all the functions at the beginning and make sure his methods would work, then he would assign tasks to each team member. 
The benefit was that Fangzhou could solve all the problems the team members would mee and the team members could learn how to do their jobs very quickly.
