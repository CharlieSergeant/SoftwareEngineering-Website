We designed a four-layer architecture to implement our project, which are User Client Layer, Web Service Layer, API Layer and Database Layer.
User Client should be running on users’ personal computers, and the other three layers is running on our server whose domain name is “yefangzhou1997.monster”. 
Besides, Python programs are running on the server to fetch daily updated data from IEX Official API to Database Layer.
Web Service Layer’s domain name is “iex.yefangzhou1997.monster”. API Layer’s domain names are “iexapi.yefangzhou1997.monster” and “iex.yefangzhou1997.monster/api”. 
Database Layer to is using the default port “:3306” to access from Localhost.
