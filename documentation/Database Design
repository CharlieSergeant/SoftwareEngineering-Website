We chose to use MySQL 5.5.62  as our database. PhpMyAdmin 4.9.0.1 and MySQL Workbench 8.0.18 are our database management tools. 
Totally, we have four tables. Three of them are for storing three compnaiesâ€™ data and the other one is for the using information.
The company tables use date as their primary keys and have all the statistic information required. 
The user table has its own id as its primary key, which could be a better foreign key than email because matching emails would take much more time than matching  integers. 
The passwords stored in database are encrypted by secured hash functions.
